# saas-sdk-python

The **Python SDK for the saas accounts API** — the Python twin of
[`saas-sdk-go`](https://github.com/codefly-dev/saas-sdk-go). A versioned,
published client that solutions depend on instead of regenerating their own
bindings.

Everything ships under a single top-level package, `saas_sdk`, so installing it
never claims a generic name (`saas`, `buf`, `datasource`) in the consumer's
import namespace.

Two layers:

- **`saas_sdk._gen`** — the generated protobuf message bindings (`*_pb2`), from
  the accounts public proto at the ref recorded in `SOURCE.txt`. Only message
  types are generated; the runtime owns the Connect transport, so there are no
  client/server stubs. The bindings embed **only** the datasource proto — the
  `buf.validate` / `saas.policy` custom options and their shared descriptors are
  stripped during generation, so this SDK never registers a shared proto into
  the global descriptor pool (which would collide with a sibling saas SDK).
  `google.protobuf.Timestamp` stays a runtime well-known type.
- **`saas_sdk.datasource`** — a gateway-bound facade over those types. It names
  the Connect procedure and routes the call through the solution runtime's
  `Gateway.unary(procedure, request, response_type)` seam, so a solution connects
  a GitHub datasource collection in a few lines:

  ```python
  from saas_sdk import datasource

  ds = datasource.new(gateway)
  source = ds.add_github_source(
      org_id=org,
      repo="codefly-dev/module-saas-starter",
      paths=["docs"],
      collection="handbook",
      access_token=token,
  )
  ds.sync(org, source.id)
  ```

  `gateway` is any value exposing `unary(procedure, request, response_type)` —
  which `solution_runtime.Gateway` already satisfies. The runtime stays
  datasource-agnostic and takes **no** dependency on this SDK.

## Versioning

This SDK's release version tracks the **saas-starter module version**
(`module/module.package.codefly.yaml`), recorded in `SOURCE.txt` alongside the
proto ref the bindings were generated from. The `protobuf` runtime floor is
`>=5.29.3` (the gencode line the bindings are built with), so the SDK installs
alongside consumers still on protobuf 5.x.

## Regenerating

The proto source of truth is `module-saas-starter/module/services/accounts/proto`.
From a checkout of that repo:

```bash
scripts/generate.sh <module-saas-starter>/module/services/accounts/proto
```

That builds a descriptor image for `datasource.proto`, strips the custom options
and shared-proto dependencies (`scripts/strip_options.py`), and regenerates
`src/saas_sdk/_gen/datasource_pb2.py`. **Never hand-edit `_gen/`.**

## Consuming

```python
from saas_sdk import datasource                 # the facade
from saas_sdk._gen import datasource_pb2         # the message types
```
